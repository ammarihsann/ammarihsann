# 👋 Hi, I’m Ammar — Sec ✖ IoT builder

I break things (safely) and build devices that talk to the cloud.
CTF enjoyer, ESP32 tinkerer, and fingerprint-driven projects on the side.

- [SCAN-IN — ESP32CAM + Fingerprint Attendance](https://github.com/ammarihsann/SCAN-IN)
- [CTF writeups](https://github.com/ammarihsann/ctf-writeups)

**What I’m into**
- Network & app security • MQTT over TLS • Device hardening
- ESP32 • Fingerprint sensors • Device-to-cloud pipelines

**Now**
- Learning: threat modeling for IoT, secure logging & monitoring
- Building: small tools to harden my next build
